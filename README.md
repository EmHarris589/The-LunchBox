# The-LunchBox
A website for people who want to take the hassle out of meal planning, and the fights out school lunch!

### Website Name: The Lunchbox

##### Concept Introduction

My daughter has food anxiety and we have worked studiously with her and her medical team over the years to build her confidence around food.  Mostly this anxiety falls into the category of trust, "will this food make me sick?"  As such, I have been packing her home lunches since the second grade.  We make many things from scratch (like hummus, energy bites, and baked goods), and she is a major part of the selection process of what goes into her lunch.  Throughout this journey, I have been documenting her lunches on social media to friends and family.  Almost all have requested this become a service.  A place where they can go online and pick from menu items with/for their children or themselves, have healthy lunches delivered, and KNOW they are being made with love and care.

##### The Lunchbox: What Would It Do?

As I've shared coding classes with some of you in the past you may have seen iterations of this website previously.  My design concept is one that provides a weekly menu with a number of different options a family could choose from.  Each of the meals would be prepared, packaged, and delivered to either home, work, or school (depending on the cooperation of the school district), so there would be stored user information.  My website would provide a gallery selection page to allow users to choose the menus they prefer, similar to FreshnLean.com Links to an external site.so there would need to be an ecommerce type interaction with a cart and potentially stored favorites.  I would also like to provide a page for users feedback and reviews along with possibly a blog where easy snack/prep ideas were discussed. 

##### The Lunchbox: Making things Easy!

One of the things I hear the most from parents, friends, and family is "I just don't have time".  My goal with The Lunchbox would be to provide a service that took some of the pressure of having to remember all of the planning, shopping, and prep out of the equation and just let people focus more on their families.  Meals don't have to be fancy to be healthy.  They don't have to be expensive to be amazing.  This website would be a way to make providing nutritious meals for your family as easy as clicking a button.
